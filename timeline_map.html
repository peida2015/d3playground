    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="description">
      In this project, I decided to play with map-drawing and basic axis-drawing in D3.  The result of this combination that is natural to me is a timeline and a map together showing progression of historical events such as States joining the Union. It is the result of heavily adapting codes from two excellent D3 tutorials: <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/">Let's Make a Map</a> and <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6452972">Brush as a Slider</a>
